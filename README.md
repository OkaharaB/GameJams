Some Game Jams I've participated in.

"Secret Dark" Was a Secret Santa game jam. The theme was "dark, dungeon, fight." I made a visual novel and added a rock-paper scissors mechanic. I didn't use any tutorials for this one, just tried doing it all by hand.

"AcerolaJam0" is a two-week jam where individuals make games based on the theme "aberration." I chose to make a platformer that defies typical genre tropes.
